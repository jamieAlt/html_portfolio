<h1>The Best Movies According of Jamie</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Drive My Car(2021)</h3>
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14039582/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_in_0_q_drive%2520my"><img src="../assets/images/Drive_my_car.jpg" alt="drive my car movie"/></a>
<p>Drive My Car sneaks up on you, lulling you in with visuals that are as straightforward as the narrative is complex</p>
<h3>Mother(2009)</h3>
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1216496/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_3_tt_8_nm_0_in_0_q_mother%25202009"><img src="../assets/images/mother_movie.jpg" alt="Mother movie"/></a>
<p>So many characters giving the movie depth, some might even find the plot development slow as a result. I felt it showed the directorâ€™s mastery for creativity.</p>
<h3>The Prestige(2006)</h3>
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0482571/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_in_0_q_the%2520prest"><img src="../assets/images/the_prestige.jpg" alt="the prestige movie"/></a>
<p>What might audiences find when peeking behind the curtain on this vaudeville act? A tense period piece, maybe a transcontinental thriller or perhaps a meditation on movie magic?</p>
